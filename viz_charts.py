"""
viz_charts.py - Chart Management Module for Flawcastr

This module will handle all chart-related functionality, separating plotting logic
from the main UI components currently set out in viz.py and/or viz_widgets.py. 

It will include:

1. Core Chart Functions:
   - Deterministic balance plotting
   - Probabilistic scenario plotting
   - Saved scenario visualization
   - Chart updates and refreshes

2. Chart Styling:
   - Axis formatting and labels
   - Grid styling
   - Color management
   - Legend handling
   - Currency formatting

3. Chart Configuration:
   - Plot initialization
   - Figure setup
   - Canvas management
   - Plot boundaries and limits

Future Considerations:
- Additional chart types
- Export functionality
- Interactive features
- Animation capabilities

This refactoring aims to make the visualization code more maintainable,
testable, and easier to extend with new features.
